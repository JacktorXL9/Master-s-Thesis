I'd like to thank my girlfriend Erica Dionisi for constantly helping me to suppress my imposter syndrome and always being in my corner. Daniel Venn for being the most consistent brotégé I've ever had. Maha Sami for keeping the investigation into the identity of her husband alive. Aaron Bondy for his vast knowledge of Drew Dilkins. Kimberly Lefebvre for constantly listening to me complain. Joshuah Trocchi for being a friendly face while he squats in our office. Peipei Zhang for all the delicious moon cakes. A special thank you goes to the crew of The White Raven for saving the world from the Dread Captain Tiberius Flint

None of this work could have be possible without the guidance and knowledge of my supervisor Dr. Gordon Drake. I would like to thank him for his constant tutelage in helping me understand the depth of the physical world.
